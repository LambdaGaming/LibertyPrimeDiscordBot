# Liberty Prime Discord Bot
Upgraded Python version of my Liberty Prime Discord Bot. The original JavaScript version can be found [here.](https://github.com/LambdaGaming/LibertyPrimeDiscordBot) This version includes Liberty Prime's basic functions of responding to keywords as well as a minigame mode that allows users to play various games. (Currently only includes Wheel of Fortune.)

## Usage:
If you want to host this bot yourself, read the notes below. (This assumes you know the basics of creating a bot and installing Python.)

- You must put the bot token in prime/settings/token.txt. See token.txt.template in the same folder for more info.
